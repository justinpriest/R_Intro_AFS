# AFS Alaska Workshop 2022: Introduction to R for Fishery Researchers
_Short introductory course for learning the basics of R, tailored for AFS fishery biologists._  


## Course Approach
This course does not assume that you have any prior R knowledge, so don't be intimidated!  

Attendees will watch the instructor present the PowerPoint presentation. At the end of each section, students will either work through the scripts that were associated with that section or in a "learnr" tutorial. In the `code` folder there are several groups of scripts. In general, these belong to one of three groups.  
**Tutorials:** There are several "learnr" tutorials, each contained in their own folder.  
**Scripts:** A stand-alone script that demonstrates PowerPoint concepts, and will either be reviewed together or independently.  
**Motivating Examples:** Completed scripts showcasing several types of analyses, charts, and data types.  

To open the code, ALWAYS start by double clicking the `R_Intro_AFS.Rproj` file. Next, open the files as normal. This will ensure that the files run properly. Don't worry if this sounds a little confusing, we'll cover all this in class!  

Code is numbered to be associated with each section in the PowerPoint, i.e., concepts covered in PowerPoint Section 2 "Basic Programming" correspond to code reviewed in `Tutorial_2_Basics` and in the script `2_Basic_Programming.R`  

To run the learnr tutorials on your own computer you will need to paste the following code into R and then run it:  
`install.packages(c("learnr", "shiny", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "scales", "palmerpenguins", "patchwork"))`  
Then opened the desired tutorial script in RStudio and click "Run Document" above the script pane.

- Recall resources to use after the class   

## Expected Behavior
Be kind: all else is details. _Remember, this includes being kind to YOU_  
We are teaching & learning this together. _Teach each other_  
Every mistake is a lesson. _Ask me or yourself why something didn’t work_
